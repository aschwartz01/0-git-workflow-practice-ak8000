## Introduction

This article is on the first human trials of Elon Musk's Neuralink chip. For the past few years, "The company [has been] developing a brain implant that aims to help patients with severe paralysis control external technologies using only neural signals." And after a lengthy period of trials, the company has finally implanted the chip into a human patient. This Patient is recovering well. It is interesting to note that upon recovery, and successful work of the chip, the patient will be able to control a cursor with their mind. 

I personally think that this is quite amazing as it allows for a future where progression of diseases like ALS can be stopped and humans can use their minds to substitute basic technologies like a mouse and keyboard. I chose this article because of the prospects that this opens up ofr software engineers. Can there be some software that can be installed onto this chips or designed in order to function with it? What about games? Other hardware that requires software? I think that this opens up quite a few possibilities for software engineers to work on revolutionizing technology, and I am excited to see what the future holds for this technology.
